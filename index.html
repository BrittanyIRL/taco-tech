    <h1>The taco reimagined.</h1>
        <p>It delivers important nutrients when and where you need it. Helps you easily perform everyday tasks in seconds. Instantly connects you to the people and things you care about most. All while tasting incredible. Yes, it’s a taco. But unlike any you’ve ever imagined.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="taco-types">

    <p>Ground beef. You’ll know it when you taste it.</p>
    <p>Because Taco is eaten like other food, you can get the same tastes and sensations you do with other food — just more immediately and conveniently.</p>

  <h2>Easy ways to eat.</h2>
    <p>You don’t always have time to craft a lengthy meal for dinner. With Taco, you have lots of options for making a quick but meaningful meal. You can even crunch short, preset bites based on the context of your meal and how you eat most often.</p>


  <h2>There’s a Taco for everyone.</h2>
    <p>Selecting a taco is very personal. As with all things you eat, how it looks is as important as how it tastes. So we made Taco from a variety of distinctive ingredients, and created a range of interchangeable salsas you can mix and match. </p>
